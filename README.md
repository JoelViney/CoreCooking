# Core Cooking

This is a simple cooking recipe website using .Net Core 2.0. It uses Azure storage as the datastore by storing json files. This is done so it can be hosted for free.

It was written to explore Asp.net Core MVC and Boostrap 4.

Technologies used:
- Core 2.0 
- Asp.Net MVC 
- Azure
- Windows Azure Storage
- Bootstrap 4
- Cookie based Authentication
- ImageSharp (kind of kludgy)


To compile it needs the ImageSharp libary installed, details of how to do this is in the Models/ReadMe.txt
